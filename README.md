# Fix3060m
IfYourVideocardDon'tWork
These problem happens in motherboards x99, x79 or anything motherboards where turn off function 'above 4g decoding' (you know, old motherboars don't have function 'above 4g decoding' and you can't install 3060m in your PC (or i don't solution for there, if you know write about)). The problem solving if you have two videocards or you decided change videocard
1. install in 3060m in your computer. If you see black monitor (without bios). 
2. Turn off PC. Include on second video card. Go in bios. PCI settings -> 'above 4g decoding' turn 'enable'.
3. Turn off PC. Include 3060m. You'll see gray monitor don't be afraid. You'll need custom driver from https://github.com/arutar/FrankenDriver?ysclid=mlleqqe0v803774109.
4. Insert in your PC. Then you'll see it's working.
If you support. You can say Godbess. Goodluck.
